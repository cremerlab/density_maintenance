# Overview

Protocol developed by Roshali de Silva and Jonas. Last edits summer 2023. 

# Required reagents
- PBS buffer: pH 7.4 (NaCl 137 mM, KCl 2.7 mM, Na2HPO4 24.2 mM, KH2PO4 5.2 mM)
- Spheroplast buffer (0.1 M Tris pH 8.0, 500 mM sucrose, 0.5 mM EDTA pH 8.0)
- 100 mM MgCl2
- 2% SDS
- BCA protein assay (Thermo Fisher Micro BCA Protein Assay Kit, 23235)

# Centrifugation settings
- Standard centrifugation: 13k RPM for 1.5 min.
- Ultracentrifugation: 65k RPM. 

# Equipment and consumables
- Ultracentrifuge: Beckman Coulter OptimaMAX Ultracentrifuge for up to 130k RPM.
- Regular centrifuge for microtubes.
- Rotor: TLA-120.1. Rotor can handle 14 tubes (seven conditions) at a time and supports the min of 100k G required. Rotor storage at 4C. 
- 0.5 ml ultracentrifugation tubes (Beckman Coulter tube 343775, 8x34mm).
- Plate reader for absorbance measurements: BioTek Epoch2
- 96-well plates (e.g. Greiner CELLSTAR 655 185) and 2ml microtubes.

# Part 1 - Sample taking
1. Collect cell samples from steadily growing cultures (2x 1ml in 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube, OD600~0.5, standard centrifugation and remove supernatant)
2. For LB cultures only, resuspend the pellet in 1ml of PBS. Obtain pellet (standard centrifugation and remove supernatant)
3. Freeze samples at -80. Freeze at least for 30 minutes but samples can also be stored overnight or longer. Note: Freezing is required and cannot be skipped.

# Part 2 - Cell lysis
4.	Thaw samples at room temperature for ~5 min. 
5.	Add 500ul cold spheroplast buffer and resuspend the pellet. 
6.	Incubate on ice for 20 min.
7.	Add 500ul 100 mM MgCl2 and mix by pipetting. Incubate on ice for 10 min.
8.	Quickly spin down tubes to collect liquid. Transfer liquid to a 15ml Falcon tube to prepare for sonication (keep Eppendorf tube). Make sure the liquid is exclusively at the bottom of the tube.
9.	Keep falcon tubes on ice. Transfer to sonication machine and run sonication. Making sure sonication dip has been deeply emerged in Falcon tube. 3x 30-second pulses with 5 sec breaks in between. 
10.	Take total protein samples (optional). Collect 20ul of supernatant and add to a new tube. Add 280 ul 2% SDS and mix by pipetting. Heat at 100C for 30 min. Centrifuge (standard setting), no pellet should be visible. Store sample for further protein quantification (total protein sample)
11.	Transfer the liquid from the Falcon tube back to the 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube.
12.	Centrifuge (Standard settings), about 1ml supernatant.
13.	Transfer 500ul of supernatant into an ultracentrifugation tube. Transfer the remaining supernatant (~450ul) to another ultracentrifugation tube. 
14.	Quantify proteins of residual pellet. The remaining pellet contains unlysed cells. To quantify the protein content of those, resuspend the pellet in 500ul of 2% SDS. Heat at 100C for 30 min. Centrifuge (standard setting), no pellet should be visible. Store the sample for further protein quantification (residual pellet sample).
# Part 3 - Run Ultracentrifugation
15.	Balance tube pairs by measuring all tubes to obtain a match in weight (less than 0.01g difference between tubes). To match, add spheroplast buffer to lighter tubes.
16.	Arrange balanced tubes on opposite site of rotor. Ultra-centrifuge for 65k RPM for 1h at 4-7C. 
17.	Take tubes. Pellets might be invisible. Completely remove the supernatant and transfer to new Eppendorf tube. Best to use a P200 pipette and remove supernutant sequentially in 3 steps. When removing the final volume, put the tip straight down to the bottom (do not touch sides as pellet is located there). Store the supernatant which contains cytoplasmic and periplasmic fraction (cytoplasmic sample)
Digest membrane proteins
18.	Add 150ul 2% SDS and resuspend (invisible) pellet thoroughly by pipetting (30-60 seconds per sample). Do this after centrifugation without adding a longer break to prevent pellets from drying out. Store the samples which contain the membrane fraction (membrane sample).
# Part 4 - BCA assay for protein quantification
19.	Preparation: Mix all three assay reagents according to the manual in a ratio of 25:24:1 to obtain final working reagent. Per sample, 150 ul of final working reagent is needed.
20.	Preparation: Turn on plate reader and set incubation to 37C. 
21.	Transfer samples to wells of 96-well microtiter plate. For membrane samples use 150ul undiluted samples. For cytoplasmic/total/residual pellet samples dilute samples 15x and use 150ul of diluted sample. Note: membrane samples contain a high SDS content. Minimize bubble formation by minimizing pipetting.
22.	After all samples have been transferred to plate, add 150ul of working reagent to each well. 
23.	Transfer plate to plate reader and start protocol:
-	Incubation at 37C
-	Start with 30 second shaking period
-	Incubate plate for 2h (no shaking)
-	Take absorbance readings at 562.
