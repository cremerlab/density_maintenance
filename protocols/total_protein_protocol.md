# Overview

The buiret method for total protein quantification. Protocol notes added by Richa and Jonas, last edits Summer 2023.

# Required reagents
- 3M NaOH
- 1.6% w/v CuSO4
- 10mg/ml BSA stock. Store BSA stock at 4C

# Standard settings centrifugation
- Temperature of 4C, 8000 RPM for 8 min.

# Equipment and consumables
- Regular centrifuge for microtubes. Standard setting: 13k, 1 min
- Vis spectroscope (Thermo XY)

# Preparation
- Turn heat block on 100C.
- For standard curve prepared in 1.5 ml tubes reagent blanks containing 200 ul of water and 200 ul of different BSA stock dilutions.

# Part 1 - Washing
1. Collect 1.8 ml of cell culture (OD600 > ~ 0.5) into a 2 ml tube. Centrifuge. Pipetting as much supernatant as possible to the cuvette without disrupting the pellet and read OD600 for cell loss correction.
2. Wash cell pellets with 1 ml of NaCl solution with similar osmolality as the cell suspension. After centrifugation, pipette from the tube as much supernatant as possible into cuvette and read OD600 for cell loss correction.
3. Resuspend cell pellets in 200 ul of water. Transfer 200 ul of the cell suspension to a new microtube and place it on dry ice.
4. Add 1ml of water to the old tube and measure OD600 for cell loss correction. 

# Part 2 - Extraction and measurement
5. Add 100ul 3M NaOH to each tube. Place tubes on the heat block for 5 min and cool for an additional 5 min at RT.
6. Add 100ul 1.6% CuSO4 to each tube, shake thoroughly and let tubes sit for 5 min. 
7. Centrifuge the tubes at max speed for 3 min. Read OD555. 

# Notes
The concentration of the BSA stock can be verified by measuring its OD280. The BSA concentration in unit of mg/ml is equal to OD280/0.63  (http://www.ruf.rice.edu/~bioslabs/methods/protein/abs280.html).
