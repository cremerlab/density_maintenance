# N-C- Base Minimal Medium 

## Brief Description

N-C- Minimal Medium is effectively a phosphate buffered base medium for growth of heterotrophic microbes. It is typically stored as a 10X stock to which carbon and nitrogen sources are later added to make a complete medium capable of supporting microbial growth. It is a high-osmolarity medium, so care should be taken when adding in large amounts of Carbon and Nitrogen sources.

## Composition

| Component | Concentration [mM] | Function | Vendor & Catalog Number |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| $K_2SO_4$ | 5.7 | Sulfate Source | Sigma-Aldrich: P0772 |
| $K_2HPO_4$ | 77.6 | Buffering + phosphate source | Sigma-Aldrich: P3786 |
| $KH_2PO_4$ | 34.6 | Buffering + phosphate source | Sigma-Aldrich: P5655 |
| $MgSO_4$ | 0.4 | Magnesium + sulfate source | Sigma-Aldrich: M2643 |
| $NaCl$ | 43.1 | Sodium source + osmolarity control | Sigma-Aldrich: S3014 |
| Carbon Source | Variable | Carbon source | Variable |
| $NH_4Cl$ | 10 | Nitrogen Source | Sigma-Aldrich: A9434 |

## Recipe

It’s recommended to store the N-C- buffer base as a filter-sterilized 4x stock. This has a long shelf life (>  2 years) and is robust to contamination as it doesn’t have either a nitrogen or carbon source.

### **500 mL of  a 4X N-C- Base Buffer**

| Component | Quantity | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $K_2SO_4$ | 2 g |  |
| $K_2HPO_4$ | 27 g | Can also use 35.4 g of $K_2HPO_4\cdot 3H_2O$ |
| $KH_2PO_4$ | 9.4 g |  |
| $MgSO_4$ | 0.8 mL of 1M stock | Can also add 0.2 g of $MgSO_4\cdot 7H_2O$ |
| $NaCl$ | 5g |  |
| dd $H_2O$ | to 500 mL |  |
