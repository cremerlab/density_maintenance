# Overview

Version of the classical perchloric acid assay. Protocol notes added by Richa and Jonas, last edits Summer 2023.

# Required reagents
- 0.7M HClO4
- 3M HClO4
- 0.5M HClO4
- 0.3M KOH
Have all HClO4 stocks cold and keep on ice during the procedure. Stock solutions are stable at RT.

# Standard settings centrifugation
- Temperature of 4C, 8000 RPM for 8 min.

# Equipment and consumables
- Regular centrifuge for microtubes.
- UV-Vis spectroscope (Thermo XY)

# Protocol steps
1. Take 1.5ml sample from culture and transfer to a 2ml microtube. 
2. Centrifuge sample, remove supernatant, and put microtube on dry ice. Measure OD600 of supernatant to account for cell loss via supernatant. 
3. Wash cells twice with 600 µl cold 0.7M HClO4 (suspension of pellet, centrifugation, subsequent supernatant removal and measurement OD600 of supernatant for cell loss correction). 
4. Digest cells by adding 300 µl 0.3M KOH for 60 minutes at 37C. Mix from time to time. 
5. Add 100ul 3M HClO4 to extract
6. Centrifuge and collect supernatant into a new 2ml collection microtube. 
7. Wash the remaining precipitate twice with 550ul cold 0.5M HClO4 and each time add the supernatant to the collection tube. 
8. Centrifuge the 1.5 ml liquid in the collection tube to spin down any remaining precipitates.
9. Read OD260 of the supernatant (typical range between 1 and 3) using 500ul liquid volume and quarts cuvette.
10. Calculate the RNA amount as R(µg/ml/OD600) = OD260*31/OD600.

# Notes
The converting factor 31 is based on that the molar extinction coefficient is 10.5/mmol/cm and the average
molecular weight of an E. coli RNA nucleotide residue is 324. Reported molar extinction coefficients ranges from 10 to 10.8 in the literature.
