# Overview

Protocol developed by Roshali and Jonas. Last edits Summer 2023.

# Required reagents
- PBS buffer: pH 7.4 ( 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 24.2 mM Na2HPO4, 5.2 mM KH2PO4)
- Spheroplast buffer (0.1 M Tris pH 8.0, 500 mM sucrose, 0.5 mM EDTA pH 8.0)
- 1mM MgCl2 solution
- Bio-Rad protein assay (catalogue number 5000002)

# Standard settings centrifugation
- Temperature of 4C, 8000 RPM for 8 min.

# Equipment and consumables
- Regular centrifuge for microtubes.

# Part 1 - Separation periplasmic and other proteins.
1. Collect cell samples by transferring 1ml to 2ml microbe (culture OD600~0.5).
2. Centrifuge and remove supernatant
3. Resuspend cell pellet in 400 ul PBS at pH 7.4, centrifuge, and remove supernatant.
4. Resuspend cell pellet in 400 ul spheroblast buffer and incubate tube for 5 min on ice. 
5. Centrifuge sample and carefully remove supernatant. 
6. Resuspend cell petter in 400 ul of hypotonic 1mM MgCl2 solution and incube for 2 minutes on ice. 
7. Transfer the supernatant to a new microbe. Optionally, store the remaining pellet contining mostly cytoplasmic proteins at -80C for further protein quantification via the biuret assay. 

# Part 2 - Protein quantification with the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. 
8. Mix 800 ul of protein sample with 200 ul the Bradford dye solution. 
9. Measure the absorbance at a wavelength of 595 nm. 

# Standard curve
Standard curves were generated using BSA and IgG over the concentration ranges mentioned in the manual.
