# 2024-05-30 Total RNA Quantification

## Purpose
In this experiment, I extracted and quantified total RNA from samples prepped 
for mass spectrometry. 

## Protocol

1. Cell pellets were removed from the -80 °C freezer and allowed to thaw on ice 
for 10 minutes. 
2. Cell pellets were resuspended in 600 µL of 0.7 M HClO$_4$ and spun at 8K xg 
for 8 min at 4° C
3. The supernatant was removed and transferred to a clean and sterile 1.5 mL 
eppendorf tube. 
4. The remaining pellet was resuspended in another 600µL of 0.7 M HClO$_4$ and 
respun at 8K xg for 8m at 4°C. 
5. The supernatant was removed and mixed with the first supernatant, and the 
OD$_{600nm}$ was measured to correct for cell loss. 
6. The remaining pellet was resuspended in 300 µL of 0.3 M KOH and digested for 
60m in a 37°C waterbath with occasional mixing. 
7. After an hour, 100 µL of 3M HClO$_4$ was added and the cells were pelleted 
at 8K xg for 8 min at 4° C. 
8. The supernatant was removed and transferred to a clean and sterile 1.5 mL 
eppendorf tube. 
9. The pellet was resuspended in 550 µL of 0.5 M HClO$_4$ and spun at 8K xg for 8m
at 4°C. The superanatant was removed and mixed with the previous supernatant. This 
step was repeated once more. 
10. The conserved supernatants were spun at 8K xg for 8m at 4° C to remove 
precipitate. 
11. The A260nm of each supernatant was measured in a 1cm quartz cuvette in a UV 
spectrophotometer.
