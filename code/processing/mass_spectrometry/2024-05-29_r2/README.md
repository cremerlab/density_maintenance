    Resulting protien per OD was remarkably high for LB and glucoseCAA samples,
    likely because I did not wash the cell pellet before freezing, keeping free 
    amino acids around. We will ultimately just use the estimation of the ribosome 
    content from the mass spec analysis.

# 2024-05-29 Quantification of Total Protein

## Purpose
This experiment conducted the total protein quantification using the Biuret 
method for all valid samples collected for mass spectrometry.

## Protocol
1. Cell pellets ('A' labels) were removed from the -80° C freezer and allowed 
to thaw on ice for 5 - 10 minutes. 
2. Pellets were resuspended in 200 µL of ddH2O and refrozen at -80 °C for 10 minutes. 
3. Resuspended pellets were removed from the freezer and placed on ice. 100 µL of 3M 
NaOH were added to the frozen pellets and the entire sample was transferred to a 100 °C heat block for 5 minutes. After 5 minutes, tubes were vigorously mixed by hand and placed back into the heatblock for another 2 minutes. 
4. Samples were allowed to cool to room temperature for 5 minutes. 
5. 100µL of 1.6% CuSO$_4$ was added to the lysed cells and mixed vigorously by 
hand. Samples were allowed to rest at room temperature for 5 minutes.
6. Samples were centrifuged for at 15000 xg for 3 minutes. 
7. The absorbance of the supernatant at 555 nm was measured a 1 cm quartz cuvette
in a spectrophotometer.
