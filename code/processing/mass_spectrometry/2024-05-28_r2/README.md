# 2024-05-28 Biuret Protein Calibration Curve

## Purpose
The purpose of this experiment was to recollect a biuret callibration curve using 
BSA. This produced a dataset where a regression can be performed to calculate
the concentration of protein within a sample

## Protocol
1. A stock of BSA at 10 mg/mL was prepared by dissolving 100 mg of lyophilized
BSA into ddH2O. 
2. This stock was diluted into 12 x 1mL samples plus one blank (ddH2O only) of varying 
concentration. 

3. A 200µL aliquot of each solution was tranferred to a clean 1.5 mL eppendorf
and frozen at -80°C for 10 minutes. 

4. Each sample was then removed from the freezer and mixed with 100 µL of 3M
NaOH. The sample was then heated at 100°C for 5 minutes. 

5. The samples were removed from the heatblock and allowed to cool at room temperature for 5 minutes.

6. Each sample was mixed with 100µL of 1.6 % CuSO$_4$ for 5 minutes. 

7. Each mixture was vigorously mixed by hand and spun at 15000 rpm for 3 minutes. 

8. The supernatant was removed and measured in a spectrophotometer with a 1 cm
quartz cuvette at 555 nm.
