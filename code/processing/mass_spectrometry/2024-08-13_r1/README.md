# 2024-08-13 Pilot Experiment

## Purpose

The purpose of this experiment was to test the feasibility of the ppGpp perturbation 
circuits in a faster-growing regime--glucose + CAA. 

## Results
A quick culture of the samples in the relevant induction conditions showed that 
for the pRelA cultures (at least), the surface-to-volume ratio significantly 
increased due to narrowing cells, and is still below the apparent SAV limit. 


This experiment will be repeated with full growth rate and size measurements with 
proper preculturing conditions
