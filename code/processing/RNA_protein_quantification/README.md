# `processing/RNA_protein_quantification`

This directory houses two data files that quantify total RNA per sample and
total Protein per sample. These measurements were collected before we chose to 
do mass spectrometry and were collected without independently measuring the
growth rate, but replicates for RNA and protein are identical.
