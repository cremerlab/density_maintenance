# `processing/flow_cytometry`
This directory houses all flow cytometry data sets for generating cell counts
per OD. They were collected before the mass spectrometry data. They present an
approximate cell count per optical density unit in different growth conditions.
Growth measurements for these samples were not simultaneously measured. Average
growth rates from the mass spectrometry data are thus used to yield a cell count
per OD as a function of the growth rate. Each mass spectrometry condition
contains two replicates. Thus, the average (midpoint) between the two is used.
